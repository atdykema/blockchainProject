# The Bitcoin Blockchain in Python
This project is based on the idea of recreating fundemental parts of the Bitcoin blockchain in Python as a way to hone skills relating to blockchain solutions and the Python language. The goal of the project is to completely recreate the blockchain to be as close to reality as possible while accouting for aspects of the Bitcoin Blockchain which cannot be replicated (history, exact timings).
