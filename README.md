# The Bitcoin Blockchain in Python
This project is based on the idea of recreating fundamental parts of the Bitcoin blockchain in Python as a way to hone skills relating to blockchain solutions and the Python language. The goal of the project is to completely recreate the blockchain to be as close to reality as possible while accounting for aspects of the Bitcoin Blockchain which cannot be replicated (history, exact timings).
## Roadmap
Currently, I am working towards building a function program which meshes all the most important and recognizable parts of the Bitcoin Blockchain so its code and input could hypotheically be used to examplify the uses of blockchain in the context of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, and even uses beyond this. It is in my intention to make sure to use the most accurate representations of data structure and algorithms as they exist in the actual blockchain. Later into the development, I may try to turn the project into a simulation rather than just a construction and use it to identify behaviors of the blockchain in different situations and with different inputs.
